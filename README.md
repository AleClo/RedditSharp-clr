# AleClo-RedditSharp-clr
This is for testing dotnetcore multiplatform. Use at your own risk, I didn't test this more than what I needed (not much).

RedditSharp target .NETStandard,Version=v1.6 
TestRedditSharp target .NETCoreApp,Version=v1.0

Working on Linux 14.04.5 LTS and Windows 10.

To open the solution you will need :
- Visual Studio 2015 Update 3
- .NET Core 1.0.1 - VS 2015 Tooling Preview 2
